## How To:

If you have a issue, make a issue.

Write a detailed explaination on what the issue is, what you did, and what this will affect.

If you are to attempt to make a "dumb"* commit just to get a contributor badge, you will be either warned or banned.

*Note, any terms like this depend on the contributor flagging and may vary.
