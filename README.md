# Setting up and config
AlceBot comes with a `config.py` file. Here you will add your Discord App token, and add startup extensions. You can generate a token at *https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me.*

Find the string `"token here"` in the config file and replace it with your token.

In the `config.py` file, you can also customise insults, error messages, bot prefix, bot description and the file you want the bot to log events to.

# Starting the bot
You can start the bot by launching `start.bash` directly, or using a Python IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. To launch `start.bash`, you need to go to terminal and type `bash start.bash`.

# Tips
Make sure to always update AlceBot. You can create [GitHub Webhooks for Discord](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to get notified whenever a repo is updated.

When you do this, always keep a backup! It's also useful to write down your token, but **NEVER** give this to anyone you don't trust, or publish it to your GitHub. Don't worry though - you can generate a new token whenever you want on the Discord developer portal.
